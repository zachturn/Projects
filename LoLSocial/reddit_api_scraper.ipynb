    "# **Reddit API Web Scraper**\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Using the reddit API, you can extract not only subreddit threads but also the comments for each threads. This notebook will grab every comment for each thread for a specified number of pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll create a dictionary that contains thread titles as keys, and the comments as a sub-dictionary of values. I'll store each of the comment trees in separate lists so that I can maintain some structure within each thread. Essentially, each sub-list will contain the parent comment and its replies, e.g:\n",
    "\n",
    "{'thread': {'comments': [[parent, reply, reply,...] , [parent,reply,...] , ...]}}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "The basic steps for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grab the first subreddit page as a .json file (as simple as requesting www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/.json).  \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "2. Take this first page, and extract thread metadata (title, number of comments, etc.) and store in the master dictionary. This master dictionary is also where the comment text will be stored. Repeat this for as many pages as desired (up to 100 max I believe).  \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "3. After all thread metadata has been collected, start iterating through the threads. For each thread:\n",
    "    1. Grab all of the comment data that a user would see initially (let's call these main comments).\n",
    "    2. Take a parent comment and start a sub-list in the thread's comment key in the master dictionary.\n",
    "    3. Iterate through each child in the comment tree and append it into the sub-list.\n",
    "    4. If a child is hidden under \"load more comments\", call the API again to expand the comments.\n",
    "    5. Repeat steps B-D until all of the main comments have been grabbed.\n",
    "    6. Now, there are parent comments hidden under \"load more comments\". Call the API to pull a portion of these comments, and apply the same steps that you did to the main comments.\n",
    "    7. Repeat this until all comments have been retrieved.  \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "4. Save the master dictionary of threads and comments to a .json file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Notes\n",
    "Detailed information on the Reddit API functions can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/). You can find details on the API rules [here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API).\n",
