       "   'i m pretty bad but personally i think karthus is decent into lb and zed  assassins who are also lane bullies  because he can avoid most of their harass by standing at max range and farming with q  which makes it very difficult for zed to hit all double q as well as single q without using his w  and for lb to hit her qw combo  she has to rely on using w to gap close and then hitting qe unless she wants to take some damage from karthus minions and put herself at more risk for retaliation from karthus   additionally karthus can take exhaust to weaken their all ins  especially for zed   use his ult when they get away from him or his team with 1 hp due to their slippery nature  and his passive lets him be useful lategame if he gets blown up within range of other enemies  personally i think assassins and other champs with weak early game like kassadin and katarina are better into him since his harass is pretty bad if he can t hit isolated q  which they can stop by standing in their minion wave   especially the former as he can blink out and come back in a few seconds later if karthus blows exhaust  as well as long range lane bullies  xerath and vel koz mostly   also i think life steal  or being vlad  is very strong into him as he doesn t have burst or cc to respectively kill them before they can heal his damage back or stop them from autoing  i have been tilted many times by dravens having bt and merc scim and outhealing my and an ally damage    maybe i m completely wrong about all this though ',\n",

gets put at a slightly lower threat  this entire post is just my experience and opinion of course  but comments  discussion and questions are encouraged                     his role tends to be one of two things  if not both: interrupting game changing cc like malzahar  katarina  fiddlesticks  etc      and or assassinating the backline carry as a mage who doesn t require the peel  he also picked to make picks  catching people when they rotate and roaming extremely effectively              the core items i would suggest on him are varied  depending on how much ap you need and whether they have a lot of cc or not  if they have a lot of cc or reliable cc  zhonyas is a must  however  i tend to skip zhonyas if their cc is minimal  or their cc is mainly on their frontliner or my target    ~ that aside  if you want late game hugely: rod of ages  seraph embrace  void  deathcap  morellonomicon  cdr   cdr boots   ~ tanky: rod of ages  rylais  gauntlet  merc  treads  deathcap  zhonyas  ~ generic: rod of ages  situation boots  lich bane ludens  their team comp     sometimes you actually don t want the auto proc  but the high q poke beforehand   zhonyas  optional as before conditions set   void  there is a graph for when you would want this  but you almost always do   and deathcap  need the multiplier for the push to consistent real burst     note that you may combine portions of these builds as the situation develops  but keep in mind why they are built  i e  if swain or vlad exist  morello might be useful to substitute into a build                        if you re facing someone like yasuo who casts a lot but doesn t reliably poke you  with ap   max e  simple  pushes wave a bit since they likely clear waves far faster so you may farm easier without being super pushed in  and lets you cc better for ganks that you will probably need  otherwise  max q  most situations   that poke may have a hefty mana cost  but it isn t over the top and that poke adds up  as well as the shield and the mana back on w  kassadins autos are strong so make sure to farm well and use the reset    note that kassadins laning is in fact  fine  he never deviates strongly to one side of weak or strong  he just exists and always retains some modicum of kill pressure   with ignite that is  i prefer ignite over tp slightly to secure his kills  but after the tp nerf  i want less of the tp and more ignite     it kassadins mid game that lacks if he didn t get fed off of roams and lane jungler  so please use kassadins better than average  accurate mage cs ing to help yourself  you can be poked a bit for going to last hit cs  but you also are good at farming under turret  put a second  in w if need be  but that farm is very important as you need to clear the wave off to roam better in most cases and to mitigate your uselessness   and your feast or famine gameplay if you really want to get aggro  in mid game for missing that 1 to 2+k gold trying to kill someone in lane early as kassadin  it important to know your damage too of course as that core to any champion                         kassadin spikes  albeit not incredibly  after 3 items  his roa damage is rather mediocre  and boots just give him a little more presence  he is a late game champion and after 3 items  starts to exponentially spike each following item  don t play kassadin and go for early trades  quickly tradeback using tlords if they close to fight on you and back off  you won t win against most champions for a bit unless you play smart                         this is rather broad  standard ap and cdr ap  10% cdr reduction and hp  are both viable  if you wanted to add attack speed runes over penetration or the flat starting ap  you are free to since kassadin is quite weak regardless early on and farming might be your main goal  hybrid pen  isn t suggested since while it may seem good  full ap is just better due to his autos scaling off of ap with a secondary passive anyway   masteries are just standard ap for thunderlords  you re free to take the extra 5% cdr or the penetration depending on how you initially plan to build him against the enemy  i would generically say build the cdr since again  kassadin takes a long time to ramp up unless you re very intelligent at using him and the opponent is put into precarious positions                           he synergises with nobody in particular nor does he not synergise with anyone in particular  taliyah  leona  jarvan and anivia are nice  but there nothing that stands out too well  he can engage if he built tanky on the backline himself or the frontline if they re out of position  likewise he can enjoy another engage so as to roam around  however  he does not synergise with team comps that are weak to cc considering the mage role is reserved to deal high dps on multiple targets  siege  or provide their own cc  kassadin is a niche pick now for comps that have cc  and ad damage    but no assassin ;and is a bad pick against much tankier teams  which is high lately  so poor kassadin                           the counterplay is to abuse his pre 6 and make his spike come far far later  he takes a long time already in comparison to get useful  making gold hard to get for him will make kassadin useless for an even longer time since he provides little as a mage without items  very  very item dependent  also after 6  cc ing him when he goes in tends to end in his demise considering he has to go for the backline or die regardless  ward to know where he coming from    at chokepoints so you can easily guess rather than just odd points where he could choose                         overall  kassadin is quite rocky this season where early game matters highly and snowballs are far more efficient on almost any other champion and team composition  that being said  he retains his niches of being able to pick champs in rotation and kill them as well as weaving through a teamfight to abuse positioning  if he gets to full build  he becomes quite a nuisance and very effective at his job of a dancing ap assassin  pick him when you need an assassin on an ad heavy team  or when their channeled abilities are a core part of their teamfight  generically of course    if you want to be a team that abuses picks  kassadin is still a nice and safe pick as well as a power pick in coordinated teams ',\n",

gg summoner username=andyeyecandy  http:  eune op gg summoner username=rqp  i ll try to answer the questions as best as i can :     what role does she play in a team composition   she very versatile and be used as different things  she able to splitpush because she stronger than most champions in a duel  often she ll be able to 1v2 in the mid lategame when she have her 2 core items  nashors and rageblade     she is however also good in a teamfight  so she is not  forced  to splitpush like someone as tryndamere  in a teamfight she is basically a 2nd adc with mixed damage  about 35%ad  65%ap when building on hit   that has aoe and can ult either herself or the other damagedealer  some times even the frontline if opponents use everything on that guy      what are the core items to be built on her   core items are nashors and rageblade  there are different variants of kayle builds  on hit being the most used    onhit: berskerers+nashors &gt;rageblade &gt;rylais+hurricane  build rylais before hurricane if youre ahead  imo   and end up with something like ga  you can build wits end too  but it not often i use it myself  this build has absurd damage but is best in sustained  long  fights    there is a ap build that is more skirmish focused  core is still berserkers  nashors and rageblade  but then you build lich bane  rabadons and void staff  this makes you heal more with w  makes q more bursty and your damage output more bursty in general  this build is therefore better in small skirmishes where you can instantly delete a person and heal up after  but it has less damage than the onhit build in longer fights and its more expensive  note this build doesn t use standard scaling cdr runes because of 10% from lich bane   if you do not own scaling cdr runes  or even normal cdr runes  trinity force is a must build imo  because it key for kayle to reach 37 5 % cdr to have perma e in the lategame  i personally get to 40%  if you use this build it goes berserkes+nashors+rageblade+trinity and then probably just hurricane and rylais  i tried it  but it feels a bit wonky and less damaging compared to others  only reason to use would imo be because of your lack in cdr runes   oh and there also an ad version of kayle but i just find that to be inferior to the other builds  sry ad kayle fans :     what is the order of leveling up her skills   always max e  and ult  duh  first  there was a point about a year ago i guess  where you could max q first because of absurd ap ratios  but it was nerfed heavily  now e max is only way to go imo   i always max w secondly  but this depends on your build and playstyle i guess  also it different if people go  e q w e e r    e q e w e r    e w q e e r    e w e q e r   it really depends on matchups  if you want to force heavy trades i would go e q e w e r  but if i just want to survive i go for the free regen in early lane e w e q e r     what are her spikes in terms of items or levels   kayle is super strong in the early  like really early  levels  she has super high damage with e  and is ranged  so in top lane she can harass a fair bit when people come to cs  she is very item dependent so in the late early game and mid game  she struggles a bit versus a lot of matchups  play her safe and farm at that point   level 4 9  or so   she also gets a fair bit stronger the moment she get berserkers because of pure value to her kiting with movement speed  this makes her able to harass and be more safe   kayle gets a huge power spike whenever she finishes items  especially when she has her berserkers  nashors and rageblade  at this point she can 1v2 almost anyone if she has flash up  and is super strong as a splitpusher   kayle scales very well with items  and is insane late game  so with a full build she essentially a higher damaging adc who has a 3sec invulnerability      what are the most optimal rune mastery setups   i always go for 1 scaling cdr quint and all blue glyphs scaling quints  total of 20% cdr level 18   combines with nashors she then gets to 40% and she doesnt need blue with onhit build  often better for the midlaner too   i then go 2 as quints and all as marks   if i face super high kill pressure laners like riven  trynda  irelia or renekton i go for flat armor seals  versus everything else i go for scaling health seals   note that if you play ap version with lich bane  you get 10%  so you can just go 10% cdr in runes   if you do not own cdr runes  i advice you to go with trinity force build     what champions does she synergize well with   kayle synergizes with a lot of champions because she can fulfill different roles in a teamfight    she can work well with peel champions  because she just damages so much   she can also work great with insane damage dealers who get in there but are likely to die  but not with kayle ult   this is stuff like master yi  katarina and so on   she actually works decent in a siege comp if combined with healers like soraka  so you just have a lot of heal to keep sieging   and just very well as a splitpusher  so with a team that is very good at disengaging if the enemies are collapsing on you  as you are splitpushing   also i love playing with a nunu due to absurd attack  and movement speed to catch up with people and destroy them  but thats a bit niche pick  ;     what is the counterplay against her   she is weak to cc in teamfights and in general  most champions  if any  will not be able to outdamage her in a fair duel  especially not when she has her ult up  also she is very reliant on items  so if you get her behind in lane she won t be able to powerfarm  and you will delay her power spike   i would always set up for a gank on toplane early game when playing versus kayle    she has a rough time with heavy engagers in lane like jax  irelia and so on  people who just outdamage her early like cassiopeia  worstmatchup com  and people who root like ryze  who also outdamage her  he can just walk away if you ult  she also is fairly weak to long range  so stuff like azir  xerath and such can actually be good against her  even in the toplane    wow this ended up being a long

       "  ['okay so as an avid kayle one trick i feel obliged to put in my 2 cents  i will tell you this much  kayle can do everything  she can go full ad on hit in the top or jungle  she can go ap burst in mid lane  ap on hit in top mid  mixed onhit in top mid or jungle  crit as an adc  requires specialized runes   she can also go tanky support in the bottom lane  she has the wonderful ability to proc aoe damage items  great sustain  good burst  amazing sustained damage  passable tankiness  endless kite  and one of the more gamechanging ultimates in league  you can play her as a split pushing bruiser sans tryndamere  as a teamfighting magic damage adc sans kogmaw corki  as an ap burst mage sans viktor  or as pretty much any other build you could possibly imagine in the game   i have 3 different rune pages for kayle depending on situations  6 if you wanna get particular but everyone knows the push pull of running armor vs scaling hp yellows   1   this is the most common rune page i use  it is used for ap on hit and adc crit kayle  i run as reds  armor hp yellows  6 scaling cdr blues 3 magicpen ap blues  and 3 as quints  the 6 scaling cdr runes will get you through to the late game where you want to go where the 3 magic pen blues will give you an extra 2 3 damage early per auto and turn into an extra 9 10 towards the late gamewhich is very nice for micromathing purposes  all other runes are common standard   2  ad kayle mixed jungle kayle this rune page is more specialzed towards triforce ad kayle which does a lot of bursty on hit damage and still a fair amount of sustained damage   you could also use rune page #1 for both builds i just find this gives you a slightly weaker early game and a slightly stronger mid late game so its a push pull   i run 9x mixed penetration reds because ad kayle is still doing a lot of magic damage to go with her ad  these scale extremely well into the mid late game  the also help with early ganking as the extra attack speed from rune page 1 deals less dps at lvl 3 to champions  9x hp armor yellows depending on matchup  i always run armor in the jungle so she can do an 8 camp clear before backing to get recurve bow  6x flat cdr and 3x scaling cdr blues  still makes 10% cdr but the early 6% cdr spike at level 2 helps you clear a little faster  and attck speed quints  if youre not using attack speed quints on kyale youre spinning your wheels   3  this rune page is for tanky support and ap burst kayle  i run 9x cdr reds  1x cdr quint  2x attack speed quints  9x scaling hp yellows  6x mana regen blues 3x scaling cdr blues   this gives your q and w maximum uptime whils somewhat helping her early mana problems and still giving you enough attack speed to get 2 autos off in the early game to force a dash or flash after a few trades   i swap mana regen with magic penetration for burst kayle as she doesnt necessarily one shot everything as she did in season 4  however she still has a very strong burst  to play her as an ap burst mage you need to treat yourself as an assassin and wait for the opposing team to blow their load and come in to clean up   counterplay against her in top lane  pick pantheon mundo olaf  all others she can beat in lane and or outscales from the free farm  nasus is also a passable pick into her however do not pick nasus into kayle in ranked unless your jungler is your duo partner as it will end poorly   do not gank kayle lanes from either side if she is top  unless shes against pantheon kayle will farm and scale perfectly fine and she will most likeley draw pressure  as far as from the other side you cannot shut kayle down she puts a timer on games  go snowball the other lanes and push the game out of hand before kayle scales  as a simple rule if the nexus is alive when kayle gets nashors guinsoos runaans you lost    mid kayle  annie annie annie annie annie annie  i cannot stress this enough pick annie  all other champions kayle can outplay assassins of any level are freelo  yasuo wins the matchup until level 6 and then kayle makes yasuo dead no matter how far ahead he was  control mages eg viktor veigar orianna  lack the tools to stop kayles farm and she will scale better than them  orianna is a troublesome lane but a good kayle can farm and stay equal  heimerdinger is one of the few champs that can outpush kayle and its both a blessing and a curse as mid late game kayle will outpush and outteamfight you but early game you have an advantage    adc  use kayles early downtime to abuse her  until she gets tri force she will have 5 8 seconds of down time  once she gets stinger or sheen it drops ti 3 9 seconds and when she completes the 20% it drops to 1 8 seconds and if running prue scaling runes it turns into perma cast at level 10  abuse abuse abuse kayle will outscale every adc in the game  though not as strong as her top mid or jungle roles she still puts a timer on you  if youre playing crit kayle your weak point is much longer but you scale better into the late game as you need 2 items to get the necessary cdr   support: by far kayles weakest lane  that being said  kayles weakest is stronger than most champs strongest  you will be maxing w&gt;q&gt;e here putting a point in r at 6 11 16  your job is to play very similarly to hw a sona would play in lane  poke with q e auto  keep your adc alive with w  ardent censer zekes banner are core  you could also run mikaels if against heavy cc comps in place of censer  your job in teamfights is to stack your passive on as many targets as possible while keeping your most fed carry alive with w and r as wella s drawin attention as best as possible  the best counterplay to support kayle is to force her to run mikaels as it weakens her teamfights by not having that extra ap  and to use her windows of weakness with e being down to poke her  she has mana problems to a point but will win extended trades  longer than 2 autos  against most supports and almost any adc '],\n",

       " 'G5, Ezreal game. Why did I lose?': [['i ll simply try to point out every mistake i think will affect you for long term or ones that i think are important no matter how small they seem to you   timing of the mistake | reasoning    |    0:33 1:03 | you choose to afk next to gromp when you know that you are playing against a morgana and a cc heavy team  if they invaded you  you would ve died 100%  always defend one point and don t afk 1:34 | your jungler starts top side  so this means you can take the camp for early level 2  in a braum ezreal lane this is huge  and in general you should always take the camp it just gives you benefits with no loss  when you see braum running to lane you should spam ping him to do the camp and swap aggro from time to time  your mindset should be that you move up in the lane since you have the xp advantage and as soon as you hit level 2 you all in them  if they back off you just zone them from xp and cs   1:52 | you shouldn t be so far back since you aren t taking the camp level 1  position yourself a bit closer so that you can poke with your q  ashe can t retaliate and she will lose auto attacks on the wave so that you will push faster  you can even take an auto attack from ashe since braum has relic shield it will heal you  in that position you and braum should aim to poke ashe with q   [this is the position i m talking about] https:  gyazo com 745d6ee400b2d2be2d25727b29abf357  2:50 | you place the ward in the bush at this point because you cancel an auto in 2:52  if you think saving a ward is better then you position yourself more to top side  because this allows you to poke ashe and you will hide yourself behind creeps 2:55 | ashe actually hits you with w because you don t position behind creeps  whenever her w is up you need to position behind creeps or you could position very close to them and bait out her w and when you see her animation you move behind the cs  3:12 and 3:18 | this is the same type of mistake  but i will refrain from talking about mechanical mistakes from now on  you are wasting mana on pointless q  both you and enemy team will hit level 3 now  but since you are pushing slower they will hit level 3 earlier than you so you re wasting mana on trying to poke morgana who will heal from levelup  and has 2 potions left  first q was mostly never going to work because she positions herself behind a minion and is a waste of mana since you can t further auto attack that creep because it range minion and you will get punished if you do  3:31 | they hit level 3 and don t step up  this means that you need to kill the two creeps at 3:34 so that you and braum get level 3 as fast as possible  but you re very slow on it  as you re killing those creeps move more to left so that you can safely kill them and protect yourself from morgana q  you waste e and mana at 3:37 because you positioned yourself poorly  3:52 | always look at the enemy carry and think when they can auto attack you  you take free poke from her  if she was good she could ve used her volley to add more damage  neither you nor ashe have been auto attacking each other when either of you want to go for cs  usually ashe would have advantage in this so you re kind of excused  but both of you are not doing as much as you can to further your lead  3:55 | if you re lower than 1 3rd of your mana pool don t try poke if you re not 100% sure it will do something  because you always need to have enough mana to e 4:04 | you now used all of your mana  even though you were protected by braum so now that your jungle has the timing to pressure or even kill bot lane you have no mana to follow up  constant poor resource management is the problem for now  luckily you play out the gank that will happen quite well since you didn t used only 1 q to farm and have enough mana to burn through black shield with your e 5:00 | you ask your jungler and support to help you push the lane since you re oom and can t push fast  because you need to push the existing and the next wave  after that you recall  this way ashe loses cs and xp  and you have a really good recall timing  if morgana stayed in the lane and didn t recall she could tank the minion damage and create a freeze for ashe and you wouldn t be able to punish that  this would give her some breathing  which is something you can t create for your opponents  5:47 | i disagree with buying cloth armor  at this point the most effective things to buy would be cull and potion pink ward which would leave you with no gold left  long sword+pink ward and potion  boots+pink ward and potion  i suggest buying cull and and pink ward since you already had a potion   8:39 | up until now you were basically getting pushed in non stop and were forced to just farm because braum is doing weird shit  but you use ult when you see braum getting hit by morg q  this is a mistake because ashe gets black shielded and most damage will be negated by it because your ult does magic damage  and most importantly you will need it badly since now braum needs to recall  the reason you need it is because you guys don t know where volibear until 8:40  but by that point you already used it  he could ve been camping a bush in bot lane and now they would take not only your bot turret but you would be denied cs  if you use your ult on the next wave you can protect yourself and deny them taking the turret  and they can t siege bot after that because yasuo has tp and braum will be on his way bot again  but you do lose dragon in that case 8:58 | because you re 1v2 and you can t farm  you now solo gromp to make up for losing the cs and xp  instead you fight for farm rather than safely take gromp  if morgana was crazy she could ve flashed+q d you and followup with ult  you would ve needed to flash that but you would still take damage  because i m almost 100% sure you couldn t react fast enough to her flash+q  in which case you lose wave  and yet again they are fucking up your cs and xp  also you and braum now have different timings since he fucked up previously  10:06 | you step too far forward when your support goes to ward  and procceed to get hit by morg q and take free damage  don t ever step infront of the enemy back wave if you can t zone your enemy by simply being stronger than them  at this point you re at a disadvantage because you re very close to being oom  10:15 | you re too far behind and too scared  because from 10:16 to 10:19 you re not auto attacking or q ing morgana  that free damage on her with no way of retaliation  only thing you need to be careful in that situation is ashe arrow 10:24 | this is the situation created by your poor resource management  if you had mana and didn t take free damage you could ve actually flashed ashe arrow and killed both of them   12:45 | no need to flash  they can t followup that  you already used your e  also use your e before the arrow  braum can just w on you 18:14 | that was almost 5:30 minutes without major mistakes  which is pretty impressive for a gold player  but you don t auto attack properly in that teamfight  there was more you could ve done if you auto attacked more boldly  18:29 18:50 | one big mistake  after you use your ult for whatever reason you basically waste time by moving left and right for no reason  mid lane is being soaked by orianna  and there is a wave pushing toward you in bot lane so your job is to take that gold and xp there  instead you choose to go to mid lane  but rotate very badly by going straight into it from river  if you really wanted to go there  don t go the risky route where you don t have vision  either go through blue buff or from the entry point next to it  going bot lane is the proper call  because you dying there actually evens out the game which should ve been in your favour  20:56 | proc sheen with your w and auto attack the turret  you re wasting time mid  you should ve been going to drake and contesting that instead of being reluctant to auto attack or not  you can just e out if ashe uses her ult 21:56 | ask your jungler for red buff  at this point of the game you can utilize it much more than rekai can 23:11| your team is to slow to go to baron  and you even e into them wasting even more time  you don t ward blue buff entry point properly and you guys weren t able to just stop aggroing the baron properly to kill volibear because of it  also at 22:42 there was also a baron call that you guys missed which would ve been even safer than what you guys did   25:55|this is the point where you guys either wait out the baron buff  or siege bot  going bot was a better idea because even though you lost baron  you still have a better teamfight so you can safely siege 27:18|you shouldn t really try to take red buff  and especially not krugs  either try to rush drake since only volibear will be there or give it up and you can do your red buff krugs  the next fight was lost mostly because you added krugs into your route and didn t ping your team to back off the drake  so you re a major contributor to losing that  28:47|you decide to e into their entire team even though you don t have an escape after that which i actually think is the reason you lost the game  but not the major one   30:56|it seems that orianna dc or afk  but either way you position yourself too far front and take quite a bit of damage from aoe and fail your e  if you lived you could ve maybe saved the game  but mostly the teamfight was lost because ori was afk    this game wasn t really your fault  but you could ve done much more if you had taked advantage of all the things i listed  i didn t want to go indept about your basics  but you are positioning improperly in fights and are wasting a lot of mana in lane  you did make some huge mistakes like dying at 28:47 or wasting time at 23:11 or dying pointlessly at 18:29 by not understanding where you should be on the map  you re also not doing as much damage as you can in teamfights  realize when the enemy team can damage you and when they can t ',\n",

       "  ['as someone who also primarily plays tanky junglers  i feel your pain on elise  she took me a long time to get a handle on  but i feel like i ve finally started to  get  her    starting off with some compare contrast with amumu   elise has a sort of opposite damage structure to amumu   amumu starts off with really high sustained damage in the form of cry and picks up burst the later in the game you go with minimal ap + ult ranks  elise starts off with high burst starting around levels 3 and 4  and picks up more sustained damage at lvl 6 with the extra spiderlings  one of the big reasons people go rylai on her is because spiderlings slow with their autos  which makes you insanely sticky in the mid late game in a dueling or skirmishing scenario where you re allowed to chase down a single target   in my mind  elise early game has three major power plays       early invade   you can start pressuring the enemy jungler as early as level three because elise clear  once you optimize it  more on that later  has that golden combo of both high sustain and high speed  if you decide to camp buff buff  you ll often clear so quickly that if you invade the enemy jungler second buff you ll find them doing it as you arrive  and usually be able to bully them pretty hard  you won t usually get the kill unless they fuck up  but you ll very often be able to blow their flash for free and zone them off of the buff and take it once they back off with no health  be very very careful to keep track of the enemy top mid as you do this  because if they collapse on you you will die 1v3  it possible to do safely every time but if you miss step you ll get punished really hard        follow up cumshot   capitalize on a laner targeted low duration cc to land a free cocoon in the laning phase  tf gold card  irelia stun  leblanc chain  there are several  let your laner initiate  then come in with the disgusting burst combo e &gt;w q &gt;r &gt;q  following with e if necessary but usually holding it for the escape  keep in mind that your transformations have a 4 second cooldown  so if you plan to do this it very important to be waiting in the bush in human form not spider form   that said  spider form has extra movespeed to traverse the map with and should be your default form   get used to transforming into human as you walk into the brush and timing it so that you can transform immediately during your combo   this is just a timing thing         bush hide   same thing as above but instead of doing it in the lane  you deward a brush in the enemy jungle or river that you see them heading towards  and e them as they walk past into your brush  starting off with such a high burst of damage will often straight up win you the duel  but keep in mind that your sustained damage spikes really high at level 6 with the extra spiderlings   be careful engaging on tanks until you have some ap and levels    in the early game during your clear  try to always maintain maximum spiderlings while in spider form  if you re clearing gromp &gt;blue  you can human form w &gt;r &gt;w to start the camp  finish with smite  and transform back into human to get a q &gt;w off for the beginning of blue  again playing around the 4 second transformation cooldown   try to get a sense for the cooldowns of your human and spider form abilities so that you aren t transforming too early or too late   you also can fit in a second qw in human form before you kill blue  which will help you clear faster and again refresh the spiderlings for the next camp  remember that if you have high health  tanking the camp yourself and letting your spiderlings dps clears more quickly  but if you have the mana to do it you should be tanking with your spiderlings to conserve health early    your biggest power spikes are lvl 3  access to all skills and the ability to go for a gank on a lane with some cc to help you  lvl 4 at which you gain enough damage to start seriously hurting people all on your own  lvl 6 11 for higher sustained damage  and then the item spikes of completed echoes and rylai  echoes gives you higher burst to start being able to solo kill squishies  rylai gives you insane sticking power poking power  with w  and high sustained damage with spiderlings    smite can be any of the three really  if they have strong sustained damage duelists tanks you feel you need help fighting red smite can help  if they have more squishy folks  usually blue smite for extra burst damage for snowballing or green smite for extra ward control to pick people off works out better   i rarely go blue smite  but if you re going with the other guy build in this thread with the protobelt definitely pick it up for the sticking power and burst   biggest things that helped me were clearing to level four before trying to go for stuff without voice com  getting used to the 4 second cooldown on transforming  and realizing that elise mid game is really powerful and that you don t need to force stuff so early as something like leesin  you can wait and scale up  it only the real late game you start having trouble  and even then only if you haven t snowballed off of your strong early and mid game    if you have any specific questions for me after trying this stuff out  feel free to shoot me a message  if you re looking for something more i m not on the current mentoring thread right now but i do replay analysis regularly  check out some of the previous weeks for how to set that up with me if you re interested    best of luck and let me know how it goes

       "   '&gt;continuously autoing while maintaining good cs    while it d be nice if you could auto the enemy adc every single time they go to cs  it not possible  there are a few factors to consider:   1  how much minion aggro will you take in return  there no point in auto ing someone if you take more than 60 damage in return  make sure when you auto someone early game  walk backwards or into a bush to avoid aggro     2  how is their support postured  if you walk forward to auto vayne and then get flayed  sona q d or leona e d or something  then what the point     3  never give up cs to harass  unless you re chunking them hard  missing 1 cs for 1 auto is never worth  but for an auto + q  sure     however  you can make everything easier by shoving them to tower  caitlyn is a nightmare to deal with under tower  because she sets traps to zone and then every time you try to cs under tower  you eat an auto  caitlyn can auto people under tower without drawing aggro better than every other adc early on     there are a lot of factors that go into deciding how aggressive you can play early on  but practice makes perfect  it better to play over aggressive rather than overly passive when learning a champion      &gt; if you have a good janna as your support  you can do whatever the fuck you want as caitlyn though  cait + janna and cait + nami are stupidly difficult to deal with because caitlyn can pressure you on every cs and you can t retaliate due to janna shield   nami e and w   ',\n",
